Jokes aside, I list my title as ${JobTitle} because of my current role at my
current job at J.B. Hunt. 

I'm a full time Sr. Operations Engineer by title, but I'm also a Sr. Full Stack Engineer based on my responsibilities and the work I do. I graduated in the Spring of 2015 with a B.S in Information Technology - Programming, and started my first job at SAPIEN Technologies, Inc. in the Fall of 2015. I have been working steadily in the industry as a software engineer since then and began my Operations Engineer journey when I started at J.B. Hunt in 2019.
